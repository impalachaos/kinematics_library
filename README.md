# kinematics-library

C library for kinematic applications. This library implements a variety of tools such as kinematic vectors, direction
cosine matrices, and quaternions. All operations within this toolbox are implemented using numerically optimized
methodologies. This artifact, coupled with zero dynamic allocations, assist with application runtime efficiency. This
toolbox is also thread and process safe.
